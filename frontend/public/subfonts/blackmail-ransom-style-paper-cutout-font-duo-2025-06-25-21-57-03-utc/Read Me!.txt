Color (bitmap) fonts are quite a new technology, and they're not universally supported (yet).

The color version of Blackmail works in:

* Adobe Photoshop CC 2017+
* Adobe Illustrator CC 2018+
* Indeign CC 2019+
* Some browsers with color font support (like Firefox, Safari & Edge)

Please check if the app you're using supports Opentype Bitmap font!

----------------------------

Note that when you're installing the font on Windows, the font preview window might look empty.
That's okay. The font will still work in Photoshop CC 2017+, Illustrator CC 2018+ and other supported apps.

----------------------------

If you do not have access to an apps that supports color fonts, you can still use the "Blackmail Letter" font which is vector based!
